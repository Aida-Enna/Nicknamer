# Nicknamer

Lets you add a nickname to players in chat so you remember who they actually are or any other information you want to remember about them.

Supports different customization per person or global customization.

## Choosing a custom color
[Take a look at this picture](https://github.com/Aida-Enna/Nicknamer/blob/main/UI_Color_Chart.png?raw=true) and find the color you want (other than 0), then change the number in the settings to the number after "UI Color".

So for example, if I want a deep red, I would choose UIColor 17. Then, I would choose "17" in the settings for the color.
