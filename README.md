## Choosing a custom color
[Take a look at this picture](https://github.com/Aida-Enna/Nicknamer/blob/main/UI_Color_Chart.png?raw=true) and find the color you want, then change the number in the settings to the number after "UI Color".

So for example, if I want a deep red, I would choose UIColor 17. Then, I would choose "17" in the settings for the color.
